# Minecraft Creative Studio for Minecraft: Java Edition

Minecraft Creative Studio (MCS/MCSJava) is a free, open-source 3D world-editing program designed exclusively for Minecraft Java Edition. It includes a range of features to help Minecraft builders, designers, animators, and others. This Minecraft Creative Editor takes inspiration from [Minecraft Bedrock's Editor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/editorinstallation) and aims to provide expandable tools that offer more creative freedom and opportunities to creators, speeding up their workflows.

Minecraft Creative Studio aims to include the best features and tools developed over the years, such as [World Painter](https://www.worldpainter.net/) and [MCEdit](https://www.mcedit.net/), while also offering powerful editing tools that cater to your editing and planning needs. Additionally, Minecraft Creative Studio allows you to expand the application beyond its capabilities through additional plugins.
