# Minecraft Creative Studio For Java
 This is a Minecraft Creative Editor similar to [Minecraft Bedrock's Editor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/editorinstallation) with a goal to implement expandable tools opening a lot more creative freedom and opportunities to map builders, redstone engineers, modders, animators, etc. The Minecraft Creative Studio aims to include and provide most tools that were developed for the past years such as [MCEdit](https://www.worldpainter.net/), [World Painter](https://www.mcedit.net/), etc.
